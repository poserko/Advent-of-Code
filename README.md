## Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code (AoC) problems.

### What Is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge where participants solve a series of coding puzzles, one each day, in the lead-up to Christmas. It's a great way to sharpen your problem-solving and coding skills.
